    <p>If you've heard of any speech on this list, it's probably this one. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech is considered one of the greatest speeches in American history and was indeed a battering ram for change</p>
    <p>nspirational speeches seek to persuade an audience to strive to reach specific goals or to live life a specific way. Commencement addresses are some of the best examples of this type of speaking, as they put forth ideas about how to live, how to think, or goals to work toward.</p>
